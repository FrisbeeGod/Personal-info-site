                        <p>I love the outdoors and can hardly stand being on a computer screen, I am a beginner coder who knows very little, however am eager to learn. 
                        I will be studying engineering next year and hopefully working in those fields someday designing parts or systems whether that is software or hardware to improve parts of the world. 
                        My experience is minimal however lies in both coding and 3D modelling which I used throughout my Co-op last year.

                    <p>TEXTRIS is a game that I designed with my partner Felix Carrillo. 
                        TEXTRIS has the same elements as the game TETRIS however instead of eliminating blocks when completeing a row,
                        blocks are eliminated when a word is formed. This means that each square of the normal TETRIS blocks will have
                        a letter. The plan is to fully finish the project and publish it as an online game that will be fun and educational, 
                        by that we mean a game for kids to play when they are bored in class.
